# Overview

TestFlow is a comprehensive test management platform built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application provides a complete solution for organizing, executing, and monitoring automated tests through an intuitive web interface. It features dashboard analytics, test case management, test suite organization, execution tracking, and detailed reporting capabilities. The platform is designed to streamline the testing workflow for development teams by centralizing test organization and providing real-time insights into test execution status.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built using React with TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The UI framework leverages shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives for consistent design patterns. State management is handled through TanStack Query (React Query) for server state synchronization and caching. The routing system uses Wouter for lightweight client-side navigation. The styling approach combines Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with CSS custom properties for theming support.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a REST API architecture using Express.js with TypeScript. The application implements a layered structure with route handlers, storage abstraction, and middleware for request logging and error handling. The storage layer uses an interface pattern (`IStorage`) to abstract database operations, enabling easy testing and potential database switching. The API provides endpoints for dashboard statistics, test management operations, and CRUD operations for test suites, cases, and runs.

## Database Schema Design
The data model centers around three core entities: Test Suites (collections of related tests), Test Cases (individual test definitions), and Test Runs (execution records). The schema uses PostgreSQL with proper foreign key relationships - Test Cases belong to Test Suites, and Test Runs track executions of Test Cases. Each entity includes metadata like timestamps, status tracking, and descriptive fields. The design supports hierarchical organization and comprehensive audit trails of test execution history.

## Development and Build System
The project uses Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. The development setup includes hot module replacement for rapid iteration. ESBuild handles server-side bundling for production deployment. The TypeScript configuration supports modern ES modules with path mapping for clean imports. The build process generates separate client and server bundles optimized for their respective environments.

## Styling and UI System
The application implements a comprehensive design system using Tailwind CSS with a custom configuration. The styling approach uses CSS custom properties for theme variables, enabling consistent color schemes and spacing. The component library is built on shadcn/ui, providing accessible and customizable UI primitives. The design supports responsive layouts with mobile-first considerations and includes dark mode capabilities through CSS variables.
